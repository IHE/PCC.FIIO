## 3:6.6 FHIR Content Modules

### 3:6.6.1 HL7 FHIR Document Content Modules

#### 3:6.6.1.X FHIR IPS Document Content Modules
This Content Module Section defines the technical requirements for FHIR IPS Documents and Bundles 

##### 3:6.6.1.X.1 FHIR IPS Bundle

###### 3:6.6.1.X.1.1 HL7 FHIR IPS Bundle Requirements
The [HL7 FHIR IPS Bundle](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition-Bundle-uv-ips.html) defines the constraints applied to the Bundle resource by the HL7 International Patient Summary (IPS) FHIR Implementation Guide. 

IHE does not further constrain the base standard outside of the specified options defined below. 

For a valid example of the HL7 FHIR IPS Bundle, review the [Pandemic IPS Example Patient Patricia Jordana Bundle](input/fsh/examples/ex-Bundle-secondaryUse-pandemnicIPS-Patricia-Jordana.fsh.html). This example patient has entries for all defined entries in the FHIR IPS bundle, including additional content that supports the ODH Option. 

###### 3:6.6.1.X.1.2 FHIR IPS ODH Option Bundle Requirements
This Bundle defines the additional requirements of the Occupational Data For Health (ODH) Data Elements that may be incorporated into a patient's IPS Bundle. These data Elements utilize the International Labor Organization Codes for to [Occupation](https://profiles.ihe.net/PCC/ODH/CodeSystem/ISCO08.html) and [Industry](https://profiles.ihe.net/PCC/ODH/CodeSystem/ISICRev4.html). 

In addition to the Entry requirements of IPS, this Bundle requires the support of at least 1 of the following ODH Data Elements:
- [Past or Present Job](https://profiles.ihe.net/PCC/ODH/StructureDefinition/odh-PastOrPresentJob.html)
- [Usual Work](https://profiles.ihe.net/PCC/ODH/StructureDefinition/odh-UsualWork.html) 

It also allows optional support for the following ODH Data Elements:
- [Employment Status](https://profiles.ihe.net/PCC/ODH/StructureDefinition/odh-EmploymentStatus.html)
- [Retirement Date](https://profiles.ihe.net/PCC/ODH/StructureDefinition/odh-RetirementDate.html)
- [CombatZone Period](https://profiles.ihe.net/PCC/ODH/StructureDefinition/odh-CombatZonePeriod.html)

The [FHIR IPS ODH Option Bundle](https://profiles.ihe.net/PCC/FIIO/StructureDefinition/IHE.FIPS.ODH.Option.Bundle.html) defines the constraints applied to the Bundle Resource for this option. 

For a valid example of the FHIR IPS ODH Bundle review the [ODH Patient Genny Works Example Bundle](ex-Bundle-IPS-ODH-Genny-Works.html).

###### 3:6.6.1.X.1.3 FHIR IPS Complete Option Bundle Requirements 
The [FHiR IPS Complete Option Bundle](https://profiles.ihe.net/PCC/FIIO/StructureDefinition/IHE.FIPS.Complete.Option.Bundle.html) Incorporates the Complete Testing option for IPS. This Structure definition binds the Complete Option Composition to the bundle, where all optional sections (e.g., Advanced Directives, Functional Status, History of Past Illnesses, History of Pregnancy, Plan of Care, Social History, and Vital Signs) are now Must Support sections.

For a valid example of the FHIR Complete IPS Bundle review the [Pandemic IPS Example Patient Patricia Jordana Example Bundle](ex-Bundle-secondaryUse-pandemnicIPS-Patricia-Jordana.html).

##### 3:6.6.1.X.2 FHIR IPS Composition and Section Requirements 
The following table shows the differences in the Composition Requirements for the Different Implementation Options.

###### 3:6.6.1.X.2.1 HL7 FHIR IPS Composition and Section Requirements
The [HL7 FHIR IPS Composition](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/Composition-uv-ips.html) defines the constraints applied to the Composition resource by the HL7 International Patient Summary (IPS) FHIR Implementation Guide. 

IHE does not further constrain the base HL7 Implementation Guide requirements outside of the specified options defined below. 

IHE has added further clarification on the expected behavior for implementation with regards to missing data and provides guidance on incorporating additional standard content within the IPS Section Requirements below. 

For a valid example of the FHIR IPS OHH Composition, review the [Genny Works ODH IPS Example Bundle](input/fsh/examples/ex-Bundle-ODH-Genny-Works.fsh.html). 

###### 3:6.6.1.X.2.1.1 Immunization Section Requirements
In order to support the meanings of Absent Data described by [ISO 27269:2025: Health informatics — International Patient Summary](https://www.iso.org/standard/79491.html) Standard Immunization Section 17.2.4 Missing: "These two situations should be explicitly documented in the IPS section: — known absence of vaccinations; — no information available about vaccinations", the emptyReason data element **SHOULD** Be supported for this section. [Open issue FIPS_023](issues.html) documents the misalignment between the HL7 and ISO Standard. 

If the Immunization data is not available or supported by the Content Creator system, then the IPS Immunizations Section **SHALL** have an appropriate [emptyReason](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-list-empty-reason.html). 

If there is a known absence of Immunization data, then this **SHOULD** be represented in the IPS Immunizations Section with an [Immunization Entry](https://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition-Immunization.html) as a [vaccineCode](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/ValueSet-vaccines-uv-ips.html) of 787482006 "No known immunizations".

###### 3:6.6.1.X.2.1.2 History Of Procedures Section Requirements
In order to support the meanings of Absent Data described by [ISO 27269:2025: Health informatics — International Patient Summary](https://www.iso.org/standard/79491.html) Standard History of Procedures Section 16.2.4 Missing - "Required if available, if not, then a reason shall be given.", the emptyReason data element **SHOULD** Be supported for this section. [Open issue FIPS_023](issues.html) documents the misalignment between the HL7 and ISO Standard. 

If the History of Procedures data is not available or supported by the Content Creator system, then the IPS History of Procedures Section **SHALL** have an appropriate [emptyReason](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-list-empty-reason.html).

If there is a known absence of Procedure data, then this **MAY** be represented in the IPS History of Procedures Section with an emptyReason of [data-absent-reason](https://r4.fhir.space/valueset-data-absent-reason.html) of not-applicable, **OR** Represented in the [Procedure Entry](https://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition-Procedure.html) as a [Procedure Code](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/ValueSet-procedures-uv-ips.html) of 787480003 "No known procedures".

A Content Creator **SHALL** support at least one of these approaches.

###### 3:6.6.1.X.2.1.4 Lab Results Section Requirements
In order to support the meanings of Absent Data described by [ISO 27269:2025: Health informatics — International Patient Summary](https://www.iso.org/standard/79491.html) Standard Lab Results Section 2.2.2.4 Missing "The implication is that no findings or results have been observed that are relevant to the present summary.", the emptyReason data element **SHOULD** Be supported for this section. [Open issue FIPS_023](issues.html) documents the misalignment between the HL7 and ISO Standard.
