This use case describes a scheduled, cross border care scenario, with the Occupational Data for Health Option. 

##### XX.4.2.1.1 Managing Work-Related Illness While Working Abroad Use Case Description
A 43-year-old woman is assigned to train personnel in another country to demonstrate use of a polyurethane foam product in hospitals. After 4 months, she develops respiratory symptoms and is found to have new-onset asthma. The attending clinician reviews her IPS that implements the Occupational Data for Health Option, which includes information about her new job. The clinician infers the causal link between the new work and the asthma and recommends changes in her job activities. In accordance to local policy a new International Patient Summary (IPS) is created.

**Pre-conditions**:
- A patient is sent to another country for work by her company.
- She has a medical exam prior to arriving in the new country where her medical record is updated.

**Main Flow**:
-  The patient develops asthma symptoms and consults a provider in the country she is working.
- Using the patientâ€™s international patient summary with occupational health data included, the provider is able to see that exposure from work is causing these symptoms. The provider recommends a change in work practice to avoid further exposure and prescribes inhalers to the patient. 

**Post-conditions:**
- The engineering company provides portable ventilation exhaust systems to reduce exposures to other workers. The woman provides training to others without engaging in direct demonstration of foam production.
- The new diagnosis of asthma related to this occupational hazard is added to the patientâ€™s EMR for the care providerâ€™s EMR. 
- A New IPS is created, including the original information imported by the provider plus the new diagnosis of asthma related to this occupational hazard, and made available for the patient to take home at the end of the episode of care.

## XX.5 ToDo Security Considerations

See ITI TF-2x: [Appendix Z.8 "Mobile Security Considerations"](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.8-mobile-security-considerations)

Consider the ISO 22857:2013 Health informatics â€” Guidelines on data protection to facilitate trans-border flows of personal health data for trans-border information exchange security considerations.  A minimum security and privacy environment has been established across all participants. There must exist security policies regarding the use of training, agreements, risk management, business continuity and network security that need to be already in place prior to the implementation. 

EMR systems should be thoughtfully designed so that providers are able to review and verify information before it is imported into their EMR system, and that positive user acknowledgements are made before import, and audit trails are recorded when imports occur. 

Imported information should be traceable both to the source [the sharing EMR], and the receiver that accepted it into the EMR system. XDS Affinity domain policies should support policies and procedures for tracing information flows between EMR systems. 

Because the information being transferred is in XML, it will be common that different EMR systems utilize different transformations to render the contents into human readable form. A Content Creator should make available the transforms used by the sending provider to review the documents, and a Content Consumer must support rendering the information as seen by the sending provider, allowing both providers to see what was sent in its original rendered form.

## XX.6 ToDo Cross-Profile Considerations

The use of the IHE XD* family of transactions is encouraged to support standards-based interoperability between systems acting as the IPS Content Creator and IPS Content Consumer. However, this profile does not require any groupings with ITI XD* actors to facilitate transport of the content document it defines. 

A Document Source in XDS.b, a Portable Media Creator in XDM, or a Document Source in XDR might be grouped with the IPS Content Creator. A Document Consumer in XDS.b, a Portable Media Importer in XDM, or a Document Recipient in XDR might be grouped with the PCS Content Consumer. A registry/repository-based infrastructure is defined by the IHE Cross Enterprise Document Sharing (XDS.b).

The On-Demand Documents Option of the XDS.b Profile may be considered or required by local implementations to assure summary documents include a composite summary of information for the patient. 

XDW may be used to define workflow for international patient care management of trans border patient care using Cross-Enterprise Document Workflow Content Profile to manage and track the tasks related to patient-centric workflows.

A reliable messaging-based infrastructure is defined by the IHE Cross Enterprise Document Reliable Interchange (XDR) Profile. A Document Source in XDR might be grouped with the IPS Content Creator. A Document Recipient in XDR might be grouped with the IPS Content Consumer. 

Detailed descriptions of these transactions can be found in the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework.
