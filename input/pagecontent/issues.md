### Open Issues
- FIIO_001: Review of the synergry between the HL7 Implementatio Guide requirements and the ISO International Patient Summary (TBD Doc ID) are inconsistant in their requirements and implications for expressing the follwoing sections: Immunizations, Results, Devices, and procedures. Primarally there are written implication in the ISO IPs that indicate the absence of these sections imply that there are no Relivant entries to report. In this case systems that do not support the data in or generation of that section MUST be able to indicate that the section or information in the section is Not Supported in a Data absent reason. This profile further constrains the the Data absent reason requirements to explicietly reflect when data is not available for inclusion, as distinguised from mediated relivant infromation. IHE has put forward comment to HL7 for allignments in future updates. IHE has also put in requests to ISO to further clarify data absent expectations and meaning. (10/08/2025)
