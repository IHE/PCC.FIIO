# Warnings Generated from Obligation Slicing in Parent Profile. Cannot be resolved in this profile. Suppressed until future solution is found. 
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/obligation|5.3.0-ballot-tc1 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)



 
# IHE valueset that is not yet a real valueset
Code System URI 'urn:ihe:event-type-code' is unknown so the code cannot be validated

# This needs to be fixed by the parent HL7 IPS Profile
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '3.0.0', found versions: 2.0.0 (from hl7.terminology.r4#3.1.0), 3.0.0 (from hl7.terminology.r4#7.0.1). Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode|3.0.0'

# We are still using FHIR R4. This will not be relivant until this profile becomes a FHIR R5 profile, then it soulw be an issue that the HL7 FHIR IPS IG would need to suppress 
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.3.0-ballot-tc1 is deprecated with the note: 'Use additionalBinding extension or element instead'
