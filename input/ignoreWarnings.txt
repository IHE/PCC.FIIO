# Warnings Generated from Obligation Slicing in Parent Profile. Cannot be resolved in this profile. Suppressed until future solution is found. 
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/obligation|5.3.0-ballot-tc1 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)


# This needs to be fixed by the parent HL7 IPS Profile
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '3.0.0', found versions: 2.0.0 (from hl7.terminology.r4#3.1.0), 3.0.0 (from hl7.terminology.r4#7.0.1). Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode|3.0.0'

# We are still using FHIR R4. This will not be relevant until this profile becomes a FHIR R5 profile, then it sould be an issue that the HL7 FHIR IPS IG would need to suppress 
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.3.0-ballot-tc1 is deprecated with the note: 'Use additionalBinding extension or element instead'

# This is a dummy OID system made only for examples, we expect there is no proper definition for it, unless we progress with a official example oid registry

# This version is the one with the extension referenced in this profile
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.uv.extensions.r4#5.3.0-ballot-tc1 released on 2025-08-03, but the most recent appropriate version is 5.2.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# This is only for an example purposes and does not need to be active for this purpose 
The concept '66214007' has a status of inactive and its use should be reviewed
